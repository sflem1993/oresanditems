As of now the mod introduces a new ore, BlockJadeite, and two new items - JadeeiteGem and JadeiteSword.

BLockJadeite spans randomly from layers 1-18 in veins of ore up to ten. Each block drops one JadeiteGem. 
Using two JadeiteGems and one stick in a crafting table creates a JadeiteSword. 
It is currently has +14 attack damage, double that of the diamond sword.

Next Updates:
  
  Jadeite Armor - coming soon!
  more new ores!
  creative/fun weapons (some combining multiple types of new ores)
